Since there is infinite gas.
This is the keys:
-I will mark the current car location as point 0 (X is for backward and Y forward) as in the graphic attached.
-Next I will choose 1 direction as a start (Let's say forward "Y")
-I will define fixed range, for example 10km to look for my friend's car.
- I will drive 10km forward (if not found him) I will go backward 10km...
- I will start increasing the range of search when changing the direction.

So here's how it will work:
I will drive 10km forward from point 0 (where I  started), if not found I will drive back toward point 0 again and from there backward 10km but here, I will add 10km in that direction, then head back to point 0 and from there, I will go 20km forward but here again I will add 10km  then head back to point 0 and from there, I will drive 30km backward but i will add 10km...
